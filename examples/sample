# This sample is written directly in the tkar protocol, rather
# than generated by another program. Usually, you don't do this
# directly, since it would be very tedious to enter all the
# movement commands. To run it:
#
# cat sample | tkar --persist
#
# Note that you can drag the boxes around and see the commands on stdout.
