switch for protocol N, if protocol changes

make most add arguments optional

height/width broken after user resizes

set select/hover colors

set radian/degrees, flip y

  screen shots

new options:

  --flip-shape --radian-shape
  
  --flip-gobal --radian-global [ replaces --flip and --radians ]

  --flip --radians [ implies both of above, resp. ]
  
  OR: do these as commands rather than options !!!

new kind of object: connector

  connects and moves with n normal objects

  defined in terms of a shape which has 3*n params: x,y,r of each part
  
    also xdelta and ydelta, in each part's local coord sys?
  
  instantiated by passing ids of n objects, plus any add'l params
  
  when objects move, connector's params are changed accordingly, reshaping it
  
  (even when objects dragged in gui)
  
  when connector is dragged, objects are dragged with it (?)
  
  a connector with n==1 is a useful special case (control point, port, etc.)
  


constrained drag motion, drop targets (per individual object)

  constrain by ID(s) of object(s) that drag must stay within

object flags

  draggable, hoverable, etc

import shapes from .svg, so you can draw them in Dia, etc.
